# 30-Day Data Science Challenge

Welcome to the 30-Day Data Science Challenge repository!

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for the 30-day data science challenge. Each day, we will tackle a mini data science project to sharpen our skills and explore various aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and more.

## Project Overview
### Day 1: Exploring Seabed Sonar Data
- **Objective:** Differentiate rocks from mines using machine learning on sonar signals.
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, machine learning modeling.
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn.
- **Repository Content:** [Day 1 Folder](Day%201)
